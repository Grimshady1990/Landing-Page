# Garden Nose Landing Page
This is my second project assigned by the Odin Project. During the production of this project, I came down with a terrible cold and my nose would not stop running. This was the inspiration for the Garden Nose project.

## Reflections

Overall, the project has been a success, but I have noticed some areas where I can improve.

Firstly, I need to focus on writing comments in the code. In this project, I didn‚Äôt add any comments until the project was finished, which made it very time-consuming. It would have been much easier to manage if I had
written comments as I went along, whenever they were necessary.

I also found that my biggest challenge is getting too involved in the process of trying different things. This can cause me to lose track of what I‚Äôve done, making commits more complicated than they need to be. I need to
pay more attention to the changes I‚Äôm making in the code. I believe being more proactive with my Git commits and writing clearer code comments will help me stay focused and organized.

# Conclusion 

This project was really fun to make, but what I enjoyed the most was having the opportunity to challenge my problem-solving skills. The Odin Project is showing me that I am more than capable of finding answers without copying solutions.
