    <h1>Garden Nose Landing Page</h1>
    <p>
        This is my second project assigned by the Odin Project. During the production of this project, I came down with
        a terrible cold and my nose would not stop running. This was the inspiration for the Garden Nose project.
    </p>

        The Garden Nose‚Ñ¢ is not a real product and is not available for purchase. The idea is purely my own and is pure
        fiction.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>This project was really fun to make, but what I enjoyed the most was having the opportunity to challenge my
        problem-solving skills. The Odin Project is showing me that I am more than capable of finding answers without
        copying solutions.</p>
