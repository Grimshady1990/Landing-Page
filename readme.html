    This is my second project assigned by the Odin Project. During the production of this project, I came down with a terrible cold and my nose would not stop running. This was the inspiration for the Garden Nose project.

    The Garden Nose‚Ñ¢ is not a real product and is not available for purchase. The idea is purely my own and is pure fiction.

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    This project was really fun to make, but what I enjoyed the most was having the opportunity to challenge my problem-solving skills. The Odin Project is showing me that I am more than capable of finding answers without copying solutions.
